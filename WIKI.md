# 📖 SNOVA-SENTINEL WIKI
### 🏛️ THE ARCHITECTURE OF SHADOW ARCHITECT

Welcome to the official documentation for **Snova-Sentinel**, a mobile-first AI security orchestrator developed by **Otto Napoleon Mendoza Quant**.

## 🧩 System Components

### 1. The Mobile Terminal (The Command Center)
Unlike traditional tools, Snova-Sentinel runs on **Termux**. This provides a full Linux environment on Android, allowing the Architect to execute security audits from the palm of his hand.

### 2. The AI Brain (Amazon Nova Lite)
We utilize **Amazon Nova** via the **AWS Bedrock API**. This model was chosen for its:
- **High Reasoning Speed:** Critical for real-time mobile execution.
- **Code Intelligence:** Superior capability in identifying logic vulnerabilities.

### 3. The Bridge (Boto3 & Python)
The system uses a custom Python bridge. It handles the secure transmission of code snippets to the AWS cloud, receives the analysis, and formats the **Shadow Architect** report.

## 🛠️ Operational Protocols

### Running an Audit
To engage the Shadow Architect, the operative must:
1. Initialize the AWS Environment variables.
2. Execute `python nova_sentinel_engine.py`.
3. Review the **High-Authority Report** generated by the AI.

### Security Philosophy: "Eternal Vigilance"
Snova-Sentinel operates under the principle that security should not be tied to a desk. By moving the auditor to a mobile environment, we ensure that **Otto Napoleon Mendoza Quant** can secure any perimeter, anytime, anywhere.
