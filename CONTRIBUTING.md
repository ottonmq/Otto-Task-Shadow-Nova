# 🛠️ CONTRIBUTING TO SNOVA-SENTINEL
### 🌌 JOIN THE SHADOW ARCHITECT NETWORK
### ⚡ PROTOCOL BY: OTTONQQ (AMAZON NOVA HACKATHON 2026)

Welcome, Operative. To maintain the integrity of the **Snova-Sentinel** ecosystem and its integration with **Amazon Nova**, all contributors must adhere to the following tactical guidelines.

---

## 📜 CODE OF CONDUCT
Respect the architecture. **Snova-Sentinel** is built for extreme mobility and low-latency security auditing. Any contribution that bloats the core engine or compromises the **Boto3 + Amazon Nova** integration will be intercepted by the Sentinel.

## 🚀 HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

### 1. TERMINAL COMPATIBILITY
All code must be verified to run within **Termux (Android Linux)**. We prioritize lightweight, high-performance Python scripts that do not require heavy desktop dependencies.

### 2. AI LOGIC: SHADOW ARCHITECT PROTOCOL
When improving the AI analysis:
- **Model:** Must target `amazon.nova-lite-v1:0` or `amazon.nova-pro-v1:0`.
- **Optimization:** Focus on prompt engineering that reduces token usage while maintaining audit depth.
- **Privacy:** Never hardcode AWS credentials; use environment variables (`export`).

### 3. SUBMISSION PROTOCOL
1. **Fork the Bunker:** Create your own branch for the new security module.
2. **Branch Naming:** `git checkout -b feat/nova-module-name`.
3. **Execution Trace:** Every PR must include a log of a successful execution in a mobile environment.

## 🛡️ SECURITY REPORTS
If you discover a flaw in the **Shadow Architect** engine, do not open a public issue. Report it through the **OTTONQQ** private channel. We practice responsible disclosure.

## 💎 RECOGNITION
Contributors who successfully enhance the Sentinel's detection capabilities will be immortalized in the **OTTONQQ Deployment Hall of Fame**.

**"Mobility is Freedom. Security is Power."**
