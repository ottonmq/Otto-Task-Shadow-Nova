​🏮 SNOVA-SENTINEL: MOBILE AI-DRIVEN SECURITY AUDITING
​Lead Architect: Otto Napoleon Mendoza Quant
Operational Agent: Shadow Architect (GitLab Duo + Amazon Nova)
Project ID: 79403601 (ottonmq)
Core Engine: Amazon Nova Lite (via AWS Bedrock)
​⚡ THE STRATEGIC EDGE: DUAL-AI ARCHITECTURE
​While traditional security tools rely on heavy desktop environments, Snova-Sentinel is a specialized deployment engineered for high-mobility scenarios. Developed and executed within Termux, it demonstrates that elite-level security auditing can be performed directly from a mobile terminal with zero latency.
​🛡️ The Shadow Architect Strategy
​The project stands out by implementing a Dual-AI feedback loop:
​GitLab Duo (Claude Haiku 4.5): Acts as the Development Sentinel, intercepting vulnerabilities like SQLi and XSS during the coding phase.
​Amazon Nova Lite: Acts as the Security Auditor, performing deep logic analysis and infrastructure orchestration.
​🏛️ CERTIFIED COMPETITIVENESS REPORT
​"OTTO-TASK is well-positioned to stand out due to its innovative use of cutting-edge technologies and its focus on improving software development efficiency and scalability." — Amazon Nova Audit (Feb 2026)
​According to the internal audit (NOVA_CERTIFIED_AUDIT.json), this architecture provides:
​Cutting-Edge Innovation: Integration of AWS Bedrock Nova models within a mobile DevOps environment.
​High-Speed Productivity: GitLab Duo-powered workflow reducing development cycles by 40%.
​Infrastructure Resilience: Scalable container management and real-time monitoring.
​🛠️ TECHNICAL STACK & ARCHITECTURE
​Terminal Environment: Termux (Linux-on-Android)
​Agentic Layer: Shadow Architect (Custom Python Agent)
​Cloud Infrastructure: AWS Bedrock (Region: us-east-1)
​Language & SDK: Python 3.11 | Boto3
